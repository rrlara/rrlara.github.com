## WA Invasives

DESCRIPTION
Invasive species are non-native plants, animals, and insects that harm native species, ecosystems, native people’s cultural resources, and industries such as agriculture, forestry, and hydropower. Expansions of global trade and increases in human mobility have resulted in unprecedented invasion by invasive species. These species threaten biodiversity, habitat quality, and ecosystem function and are believed to have contributed to the decline of 42% of the endangered and threatened species in the United States. In Washington, the costs of dealing with invasive species are in the millions of dollars each year.
Managing invasive species here in Washington State is complex due to the number and types of pathways through which species are introduced. A number of local, state and federal agencies and organizations work to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, physically control or eradicate them, monitor their distribution, and understand their characteristics. Now you can help contribute to identifying and reporting invasive species before they become a bigger problem. The goal of this mobile app is to make species identification easier and help improve detection and reporting of harmful invasive species statewide
You can submit invasive species sighting reports directly with your mobile device where they occur. These sighting reports are submitted to Washington Invasive Species Council (WISC) staff and technical experts throughout the state to review and approve sighting reports. Sightings that are approved will be viewable directly through the app’s mapping tool. You can also learn more about priority invasive species in Washington with easy-to-understand descriptions and images. This mobile app is part of an integrated invasive species reporting and outreach campaign for WISC that also includes a website with an online reporting form.
FEATURES
