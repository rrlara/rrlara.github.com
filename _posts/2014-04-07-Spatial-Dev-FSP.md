VISUALIZE FINANCIAL ACCESS
Increasing poor people's access to financial services can help them weather personal financial crises and increase their chances of climbing out of poverty. The FSP interactive map tool plots financial service locations throughout Africa. This tool can be used to identify gaps in access to financial services, and to design policy and inform decision-making.
